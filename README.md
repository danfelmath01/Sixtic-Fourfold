# More on G_4 flux and General Hodge Cycles on the Fermat Sextic
Below, we present the codes used in the article to perform some of the calculations associated with algebraic cycles.

1) The library "HodgeProject.lib" written in SINGULAR contains the procedures IntersecMatrix, LinAlgCycles, ASAlgCycles and T3AlgCycles

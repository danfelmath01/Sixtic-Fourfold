# Sixtic-Fourfold
We give an explicit basis for the algebraic cycles of the sixtic  Calabi-Yau fourfold. 

Indlc: It is a list of the l.i. linear cycles used in the construction of the basis of algebraic cycles of the sixtic Calabi-Yau fourfold.
IndAS: It is a list of the l.i. Aoki-Shioda cycles used in the construction of the basis of algebraic cycles of the sixtic Calabi-Yau fourfold.
Indt3: It is a list of the l.i. type 3 cycles used in the construction of the basis of algebraic cycles of the sixtic Calabi-Yau fourfold.

# More on G_4 flux and General Hodge Cycles on the Fermat Sextic
Below, we present the codes used in the article to perform some of the calculations associated with algebraic cycles.

1) The library "HodgeProject.lib" written in SINGULAR contains the procedures IntersecMatrix, LinAlgCycles, ASAlgCycles and T3AlgCycles. These procedures are used to compute a basis of the algebraic cycles for the Fermat Sextic quarfold. Moreover, they are used to compute a intersection matrix of this basis.
2) In "Basis of algebraic cycles" we describe the explicit basis of algebraic cycles for the Fermat Sextic quarfold.
3) In "Intersection Matrix" we compute the intersection matrix.
4) In "general Hodge cycles" we compute the rank of the matrix rho in order to determine if a cycle is a general Hodge cycle, and also we compute the tadpole associated to that cycle.
